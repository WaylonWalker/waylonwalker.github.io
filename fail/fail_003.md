#### Pick Me Up

This week is the last week before Rhiannon's chemotherapy, and it is a struggle for her.  I do all that I can to help her, but sometime I feel like I cannot do enough to keep her up.  Yesterday she was very down and was constantly negative.  It was part of her anxiety, she was having lots of it.  I felt like there was nothing that I could do to keep pick her up.  I felt like I failed in helping her, because it was bringing me down.  I need to remember what she is going through and do the simple things that help her.  I also think there is some research that I can do to help learn how to pick someone up when they are down.

#### Resolution


* Fill her love tank
    * physical touch
    * gifts
* Research helping someone through an anxiety attack
