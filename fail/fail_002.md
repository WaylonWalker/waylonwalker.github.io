#### Calm

Lately with Christmas coming up we have been struggling with both of our kids having meltdowns.  I am greatful that for the most part I have been able to keep my calm but there have been a few instances that have really tested me.  For instance. Yesterday was "Wear a special hat day" at prechool.  Ayla was in a meltdown mode as we were leaving the house, and did not want hers at the time we were leaving when in fact I knew that she would want it when we got to school.  When we got there, sure enough everyone else had a special had, except for her, she was devastated.

#### Resolution

Keep Calm, know your kids, and plan for them to calm down.  I knew she would want her hat when she calmed down and saw everyone else with theirs.  I should have brought it with us and gave her another chance when we got to preschool.  While this is a learning opportunity for her. She is still little and I need to remember this, give her a break and plan for the calm down.
