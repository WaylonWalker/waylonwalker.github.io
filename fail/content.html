<p>Yesterday I failed to get to my number one project on my project list. This is partially due to some extra things going on; dr. visits, desk moves, etc... But the number one reason is that I did not prioritize properly. I stuggle to prioritize sometimes, and I am making changes to help with this. I am keeping a running trello board. This helps me to take time at one time and determine what the most important things are for the day/week, then I need to execute them, and not stray too far off track.</p>
<h4 id="resolution">Resolution</h4>
<p>Keep the trello board up to date, and execute througout the day. Leave room in the board for interruptions, but be specific enough that priority projects keep moving.</p>
