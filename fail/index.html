<h4 id="pick-me-up">Pick Me Up</h4>
<p>This week is the last week before Rhiannon's chemotherapy, and it is a struggle for her. I do all that I can to help her, but sometime I feel like I cannot do enough to keep her up. Yesterday she was very down and was constantly negative. It was part of her anxiety, she was having lots of it. I felt like there was nothing that I could do to keep pick her up. I felt like I failed in helping her, because it was bringing me down. I need to remember what she is going through and do the simple things that help her. I also think there is some research that I can do to help learn how to pick someone up when they are down.</p>
<h4 id="resolution">Resolution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fill her love tank
<ul>
<li>physical touch</li>
<li>gifts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Research helping someone through an anxiety attack</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="calm">Calm</h4>
<p>Lately with Christmas coming up we have been struggling with both of our kids having meltdowns. I am greatful that for the most part I have been able to keep my calm but there have been a few instances that have really tested me. For instance. Yesterday was &quot;Wear a special hat day&quot; at prechool. Ayla was in a meltdown mode as we were leaving the house, and did not want hers at the time we were leaving when in fact I knew that she would want it when we got to school. When we got there, sure enough everyone else had a special had, except for her, she was devastated.</p>

<p>Keep Calm, know your kids, and plan for them to calm down. I knew she would want her hat when she calmed down and saw everyone else with theirs. I should have brought it with us and gave her another chance when we got to preschool. While this is a learning opportunity for her. She is still little and I need to remember this, give her a break and plan for the calm down.</p>

<h4 id="focus">Focus</h4>
<p>Yesterday I failed to get to my number one project on my project list. This is partially due to some extra things going on; dr. visits, desk moves, etc... But the number one reason is that I did not prioritize properly. I stuggle to prioritize sometimes, and I am making changes to help with this. I am keeping a running trello board. This helps me to take time at one time and determine what the most important things are for the day/week, then I need to execute them, and not stray too far off track.</p>
<h4 id="resolution-2">Resolution</h4>
<p>Keep the trello board up to date, and execute througout the day. Leave room in the board for interruptions, but be specific enough that priority projects keep moving.</p>
