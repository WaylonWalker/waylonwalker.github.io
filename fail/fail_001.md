### Fail #001

#### Focus

Yesterday I failed to get to my number one project on my project list.  This is partially due to some extra things going on; dr. visits, desk moves, etc... But the number one reason is that I did not prioritize properly.  I stuggle to prioritize sometimes, and I am making changes to help with this.  I am keeping a running trello board.  This helps me to take time at one time and determine what the most important things are for the day/week, then I need to execute them, and not stray too far off track.


#### Resolution

Keep the trello board up to date, and execute througout the day.  Leave room in the board for interruptions, but be specific enough that priority projects keep moving.
