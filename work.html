<div class="card"> <h2><a href="http://pydatavizday.herokuapp.com/enthusiast">pyDataVizDay</a></h2><p>I was asked to speak about visualization in python at a data visualization conference in August 2017.  All of the speakers of the conference were asked to create a visualization based on Kaggle's <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata'>TMDB 500 Movie Dataset</a>.  I created a flask web app that is running on heroku.</p></div><div class="card"><h2><a href="http://www.waylonwalker.com/bbbs_2017">bbbs_2017</a></h2><p>I participated in the 2017 Big Brothers and Big Sisters Data Challenge.  This was a really fun event that allowed me to look at a completely different data set than I am used to, and provide some insights back to the local community.  If I were to do it again I would try a bit harder to find a partner.  I found out about the event shortly before the sign up, and decided to go solo.  </p><p>The data cleansing step was quite a big job in order to get the data into a usable format.  This took most of my time.  I was a bit overwhelmed trying to find insights from the large number of features.  The number of records was also relatively small (>500 records) with many of the questions either being very one sided i.e. most survey results were of the same value, or it was very distributed and did not seem to correlate well with the metrics that I identified.</p></div>
