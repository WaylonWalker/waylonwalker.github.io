_Packages that I have globally installed for my automation toolchain_

For as verbose as it is, and sometimes causes issues.  I have been using gulp to auto compile pug, sass, and es6 on file changes and refresh the browser with browsersync.  I am looking into changing ot npm run watch, but have not found a simple toolchain to work as well as my gulp setup.

* gulp
* gulp-watch
* gulp-pug
* gulp-sass
* gulp-browserify
* browsersync
* autoprefixer
