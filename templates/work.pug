    p I was asked to speak about visualization in python at a data visualization conference in August 2017.  All of the speakers of the conference were asked to create a visualization based on Kaggle's <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata'>TMDB 500 Movie Dataset</a>.  I created a flask web app that is running on heroku.
