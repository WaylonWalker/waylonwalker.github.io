I still have hopes to keep going and make most weeks happen this year.
</p><p>Strained for time I decided to work with plotly.js for the first time.  It seemed like one of the easist mapping libraries that I have worked with.  For my initial view I dropped the data in and everything just worked.  I always seem to have issues with units and scaling.  I will definitely be using plotly.js again.  The one pain point that I had with using plotly.js directly was that I was using python for the data and it was a bit cumbersome to format the data in a short time slot without a good api.
</p><p>For this viz I wanted to make it simple. So I searched for the most common animal_id, found that leo was the most common. Next I found the months in which Leo had a slow moving latitude movement, marked those a summer/winter, calculated the average location over those months and plotted.  Not very exciting but I got something down.


</p><div class="card" id="viz"><h1>Leo's Nesting Regions</h1><p>Leo tends to nest in very similar.  Zoom in to find out how close his average location is during the Summer and Winter Months.</p><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"/><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"/><title>Migration</title><script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script><style>@import url("https://goo.gl/RrPQm5")
