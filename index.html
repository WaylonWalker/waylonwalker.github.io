Family always come first in our house.  We are a strong family that supports each other through thick and thin.  Over the years we have encountered many struggles, but we always try to maintain a positive outlook.</p>
<p>During the day I am a Data Scientist, part Engineer, part Software Developer.  I enjoy diving into complex problems and finding creative ways to use data so answer questions</p>
