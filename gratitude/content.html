<h4 id="kid-time">Kid Time</h4>
<p>Sometimes you just need some time to be a kid. Today was that day... it was a snow day. During which the kids were very generous at letting me work, but we were also able to have some quality moments. First of which happened at lunch. Wyatt decided that we were having pancakes, and the kids would help make them. I was really impressed at their cooperation. They did really well at taking turns putting ingredients into the batter, and stirring.</p>

<p>The second bit of kid time came late in the afternoon after the kids had a nap. We went outside to go sledding. They were both a bit crabby to get clothes on, but cheered up once we got outside. We all had a blast, Even Ayla who has had a terrible fear of the snow this year. She just stood in it for the longest time before warming up to it. Eventually she braved up enough, aka was forced on to the sled with daddy. She loved it! She was absolutely smiling ear to ear when we hit the bottom. From there on the kids took turns riding down with daddy for the next 2 hrs!</p>

<h4 id="adult-time">Adult Time</h4>
<p>There is something special about having pure uninterrupted adult time with your spouse. Last night I went out with Rhiannon and we had an absolute blast. We went to the brand new brewery in town &quot;Industry Brewing Company&quot;. It was absolutely amazing. The food was good, but the beer was completely flawless. There is just something beautiful about something that is so flawless. Each style I had was brewed to a T. My favorite of course was the &quot;Industry Standard&quot;, a super hoppy pale ale.</p>
<p>Next we were off to the local big box quilting store to get some supplies for Rhiannon's next project on Cuttin Scrap. It was fun, we looked at a bunch of different stuff. And she was able to talk shop.</p>
<p>After that we were off to see the latest Pitch perfect movie. before we were able to do that I required coffee to stay up through the whole thing. So we went downtown to check out Zion coffee roasters for the first time. It was a beautiful shop that reminded me of Horizon Line Coffee in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. We finished the night off in the movies and headed home.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to be able to spend such quality time with my best friend. We have great friends that are able to watch the crazy kids. We are able to afford a simple night out. Lastly Rhiannon and I are getting closer than we ever have before.</p>

<h4 id="good-tunes">Good Tunes</h4>
<p>Recently the kids have really been into singing in the car with Daddy on the way to and from Preshool. It is so fun, because we are all belting it out so loud, and each take over for our special parts. It's interesting how Ayla has grown into liking it. For the longest time I thought that she did not like Wyatt and I being so loud, but she never complained about it. Then over the past week I noticed during some parts of the songs she is the <strong>LOUDEST</strong> one in the car. After each song the kids both ask, &quot;Did I sing the whole song?&quot;, and I try to get super into it and have a very motivational Radio DJ style of voice encouraging them to continue and tell them how well they did.</p>

<h4 id="my-parter">My Parter</h4>
<p>Last night stared like any other night. Put the kids to bed, hang out with my Beautiful wife for a while, off to sleep, then Wyatt comes in at the wee hours of the morning ready to start his day. The only difference last night was that it was not the wee hours of the day, it was <strong>11:30 PM</strong>. He was wired and ready to go as if he slept the whole night through. I am very grateful that I was able to tag team the situation with Rhiannon, as he did not go back to sleep. We were both able to get some rest through the night. It may not have been the best, but we were able to make the best out of a tough situation. In the Morning we had to take the van into the repair shop, and on the way home we were able to discuss some solutions to the problem when it happens in the future. Rhiannon was able to get the ball rolling with the pediatrician to see their recommendations. Man I love her, long before I would have even thought to go that route she had already sent the message out.</p>

<h4 id="my-first-french-braid">My First French Braid</h4>
<p>Tonight was the last night of the big holiday vacation and I finally got that special moment with every single family member over break. It was Ayla's turn tonight. We had our break when Wyatt wanted mommy to play MineCraft with him and did not want daddy to play. Ayla's hair looked like a bird was trying to built its nest in it. We made our way upstairs with a spray bottle, comb, brush and a whole lot of excitement. We filled the spray bottle with water, and I let Ayla start going to town spraying everything in sight. Although it was explicitly stated that it would not be used for its intended purpose, detangling hair. Thats ok though as I was able to get some moisture in with my hands. I continued to do my first french braid on her. The first attempt was a fail as Ayla was moving too much and I lost it. The second attemt was a success. After this Ayla proceeded to water, brush, wipe, and comb daddy's har over the next hour!</p>
<p>I ran out of time, but I will still mention that she painted her first set of toes.</p>

<h4 id="breaks">Breaks</h4>
<p>Breaks are a good time for refresh and focus on some other things. During this holiday break I have been able to spend quite a bit of time with my beautiful wife Rhiannon. I have really enjoyed helping her setup her new adventure <a href="www.cuttinscrap.com">Cuttin Scrap</a>. It will be a nice creative outlet for her to combine her love of sewing and crafting with her love of speech and writing. I am really excited to see her get going.</p>
<p>We have also spent some time at nights playing games and watching YouTube. Its really nice to not have to worry about anything work related and focus on the family. The extra time has helped strengthen our marriage and allow us to discuss some things that have been on our minds for awhile. Now its time to start 2018 Fresh and Strong.</p>

<p>Last night we made a long trip back from my In-Laws. Which was a great day by the way. Sometimes we struggle with Wyatt's energy in a house with lots of breakable items, but he did great yesterday. When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired... at 11:00 PM. He was hungry, as he was too excited to play while at grandmas house and did not eat much. I sat up with him, we shared a peanut butter sandwich and got out a new pack of trolls characters and worked on finding all of their names.</p>

<p>Moments like these do not seem to come often enough. I really enjoy playing with the whole family and the full level of craziness that it brings, but having a calm one on one time with one member of the family seems extra special. It was the perfect ending to a long day with lots of packing, travel, and excitement.</p>

<h4 id="special-moments">Special Moments</h4>
<p>I love having those special moments of time with the kids. Today we had a few minutes to play before supper time, and we decided to go down to the basement to play some imagination action adventure game. The kids are really into minecraft at the moment so its always very centered around minecraft. Tonight there was an extra special moment where Wyatt on his own gave Ayla his brand new nerf gun to play with. At this point he has not alowed her to play with it because it was a new Christmas toy. She was extatic, and we all enjoyed running from her as she shot towards us. I thought it was extra special because we were all having fun and no one was arguing about who got the new toy. I am so proud of Wyatt, because he is really growing up and growing out of the not sharing phase. I have really seen him open up to share an play with Ayla in new ways lately. It really makes you feel like a good parent when you can watch them grow up like this.</p>

<p>This Christmas we had two events on Christmas day, with 5 hours of travel, and a final destination to sleep at. I am very grateful that we were able to get through all of the travel in one piece. THe kids had a blast! It was a very fun Christmas for them. Wyatt got his most wished for gift this year, Maui's hook from Moana. It was so fun to watch him open it. He was absolutely speechless.</p>
<p>I am glad everyone was able to enjoy the food. Both events were very accomodating to our family allergies. The first event was a potato bar where everything was kept separate and you could personalize your dish. The kids really just wanted to snack all day. At the second event they went out of their way to find dairy free butter to cook wtih. There were only one or two items that had dairy in them. It feels good to be supported by your family.</p>

<p>Good days are the best. I enjoy the days where everything seems to fall into place seemingly without effort. The air is clean and easy to breathe. The kids are cooperating. I am working on a project with my best friend in the world. I play with my kids, and we all have a great time together.</p>
<p>Today was one of those days. I spent much of the day helping Rhiannon set up the Cuttin Scrap channel. We are setting up a really nice area for her to work on a craft that she is very passionate about. It is the place that she has dreamed of for years. No its not perfect with the most space available, but it is the best with what we have got, and it is all hers. At the end of the day we were able to sit down and begin working through her website and socials.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed getting to play in the fresh snow with Wyatt. He loved it. We shoveled it into big piles to jump in, threw snowballs, and just had the best of adventure. Ayla and Rhiannon came to the window to watch, and they laughed at us while we acted silly. Today was Christmas, one of the most magical days of the year to spend with the ones you love most.</p>

I am glad to see some of the changes that my parents are making to get through their tough times at home. They seem to be quite a bit happier that the past few times that we have been home. We all got some really nice gifts, and I am glad that everyone was able to at least get something that they enjoy, even if it wasn't much. The kids were so excited to see all of the gifts, and had such fun opening them. They have been playing with them all day. I am very grateful to see them sharing and having fun together rather than fighting over who gets what. Wyatt has really been stepping it up as a big brother, and even spent his own hard earned money to buy Ayla a gift!</p>

<p>A few months ago my wife and I decided to start going to family therapy, to talk about some things that we could see were only going to get worse without giving them some attention. This is the best decision we have made in our marriage. We have really learned to relate to the other person, and put ourself in their shoes. We are learning about how our actions effect the other.</p>

<p>Without taking steps in the right direction our marriage was heading downhill. Medical needs were taking precidence, and we were both fighing through a dark hole of depression. After the first session we saw great improvement. I am grateful that we took the steps to work on our marriage in such a dark time for us on every other aspect of life. I am grateful that we got a great therapist on first try. I feel like you rarely get a medical professional that works for you on the first try. I am grateful that we are both devoted to making it work, and have made great strides in our relationship. Most of all I am grateful to see how taking the right steps to strengthen our marriage has improved other parts of our life, and made it easier to handle events as they come up.</p>

I am grateful that we were able to get in with a really good oncologist. The best in the area in terms of carcinoid cancer. I am really glad that he has a plan for us and it is helping get through most of the month between doses. Since it is such a rare type of cancer there are few knowledgeable in the subject, which just makes it that much better that we are in with the best. It allows us to have some really good days.</p>

<p>I have been getting back on my feet after a long turn of a low mindset. My wife has been my main inspiration through this process. She is working very hard herself to be a more positive person, and has been for several months. She has been my inspiration. I have started this journal, drinking keytones, tracking goals, keeping up with email, trello, using pomodoro, and started working out. All of these steps are giving me strength to keep a positive attitude through a very rough time in our life. I am very happy with the improvements that I have made over the last 8 days, and glad that these changes are giving me the strength to keep a positive attitude through the day.</p>

I enjoy being able to support everyone in their appointments, and making sure that everyone is able to get where they need to be every day.

<p>My job allows me to work almost any hour that I can. There are meetings and events that I need to be in person for, but those are only a small portion of the work. The one thing that I have struggled with since our move is being productive at home. The new house is a completely different environment than I am used to. There are lots of distractions and <strong>SLOW</strong> internet. The internet speed is so slow that I tend to get distracted and do other things when something that is usually executed within a few ms takes 30s or more. I know it sounds rediculous but when every step takes this much extra time it gets very distracting. It is something that I just need to learn to work with, and keep a project ready to work with little to no internet at all times.</p>

<p>Restarting each day is important for a very healthy attitude. Having a son with ADHD there are times where we need to restart each hour on a new foot. His mind runs at such a faster pace than everyone else's that is can be hard to keep up with him. Sometimes we have meltdowns. It is very important to be able to coach him through it, present him with a resolution, and walk away. It is very hard as an adult to quickly bring down your emotions form a very high stress situation, but it is important for him to avoid going right back into another meltdown. Our family is very good at restarting each day on a new foot and not holding grudges against each other. This keeps us very strong through such hard times.</p>

We are able to share our whole lives with out family. Having a supportive family is very important, because without their support things get awkward. I am glad to live in a family where we can talk about anything, and support each other through almost anything as well, though we aren't afraid to point out each others dumb ideas if something really seems off. There is also the physical part of family. We are able to share some of the workloads. Today we had some extra family in the house and it was nice to have a few minutes here and there that I could get away and know that someone would take care of the kids if they needed something.</p>

<h4 id="time-off">Time Off</h4>
<p>I am currently in the middle of a week long holiday break. Its nice to take some time off from the everyday hustle to refresh the brain and focus on some other things. We are able to do quite a bit of traveling and see family that we do not get to see very often. I am able to spend more time with my wife and the kids. I have also started making a website for my wife. Its probably something that I would not otherwise have time to dig deeply into and make nearly the same progress as quickly.</p>
<p>The time in the car can be a nice time to connect. We have taken quite a bit of time to plan out Rhiannon's new adventure, CuttinScrap. It is a YouTube channel that will serve as her creative outlet, combining her love of speech and Drama with Crafting. I am really excited to see her find her voice and get into a rhythm with the channel. She is really excited as well. We have been doing a lot of planning and behind the scenes work and anxiously awaiting time to make episode 0.</p>
