#### Vacation Time

Over the past 6 days I was able to take a well needed break with Rhiannon.  It was great to get away from the daily grind and spend some time with my beautiful wife. We both were able to swim in the ocean for the first time together at Hollywood Beach in Florida.  It was quite the experience for the both of us.  The power of the waves, the taste of the salt, the deep blue color of the ocean,  and the pure white sand was something that is undescribable.

Throughout the course of our adventures Rhiannon's health was impecable.  She was able to hold everything together throughout the whole trip.  We only ran into one occasion of smoke.  She was able to walk to most of the events we had planned.  She was feeling better than she has felt in a very long time.  Just seeing her do so well was very uplifting.
