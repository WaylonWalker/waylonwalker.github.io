<h4 id="family">Family</h4>
<p>Having a close family is one of the most important things in life. They keep us grounded. They are able to tell us things that no one else can. We are able to share our whole lives with out family. Having a supportive family is very important, because without their support things get awkward. I am glad to live in a family where we can talk about anything, and support each other through almost anything as well, though we aren't afraid to point out each others dumb ideas if something really seems off. There is also the physical part of family. We are able to share some of the workloads. Today we had some extra family in the house and it was nice to have a few minutes here and there that I could get away and know that someone would take care of the kids if they needed something.</p>

<h4 id="sleep">Sleep</h4>
<p>It does not get enough recognition, some good quality rest is very benefitial to start off a good day. Yesterday I was dragging.. hard. Wyatt was up at 2 A.M. and I was the one to be up with him... for awhile. Today, he was up early again, but let me sleep, then proceeded to take a morning nap. This combined with an early rest time started my day off on a good note. I was able to wake up when ready, and start my day at my own pace. I was able to get coffee and breakfast before being asked to do much.</p>

I enjoy starting my day off with a nice cup of coffee. Today, I had a nice fresh thirty-thirty guatememala. I am very grateful that we are able to afford nice coffee, it really energizes me compared to the really dark mass produced coffee that is typically found everywhere.

<h4 id="community">Community</h4>
<p>I know that I am not the most social person that is ready to talk to everyone in the room about anything. I am still grateful for the communities that I am a part of. Without our group of friends we would not be able to make it through all of the medical issues that we have had throughout the past few years. Rhiannon and I are currently making great strides in our marriage and fincance thanks to the great help from Scott and Ali. Without Rhiannon's medical community she would not be here today. From getting her diagnosis to executing their plans every step along the way has given her more years on her life. Those years will be happily spent with the kids and I.</p>

<h4 id="persistence">Persistence</h4>
<p>Persistence is one of the great talents of my wife. Today I am grateful for her persistence because she has the medicine that she needs for her MRI today. Yesterday there was a struggle to get the doctors to get her prescription submitted to the pharmacy, and after calling many times she got it done within the last hour of the pharmacies operating hours. Seriously who can get a prescription filled after 7:00PM! I am just glad that she is able to have the medicine that she needs today. It will make the procedure much easier.</p>

<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
Seriously though without her persistence she would not even be here today. Her persistence to get an accurate diagnosis was what kept her alive on more than one occasion. There is something to be said for trusting your gut and standing behind what you believe in.

<p>Thank You for getting up with me this morning. I really appreciate all of the extra help. It means a lot to have my life partner there with me in the morning helping with the kids.</p>
<h4 id="thank-you">Thank You</h4>
<p>Those two words are very powerful. This morning when I was helping Rhiannon cut her hair she looked at me and told me thank you very sincerely. It cut really deep inside, and made me feel really good. I dont think I expressed my gratitude for it very well as I had not yet had my coffee, and my response time was a bit lacking. This is something that I would like to work on with my kids. We really focus on our please's but, sometimes Thank Yous are forgotten, and we are just happy that they are happy.</p>

<p>Overall I am most grateful today for the good morning that I have had with my beautiful wife Rhiannon and our two kids, Ayla and Wyatt.</p>
