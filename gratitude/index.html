<h4 id="special-time">Special Time</h4>
<p>This morning Wyatt came into our room just as normal, chipper as can be ready to go. But something was different than normal. I felt like I had just hit the pillow. I grabbed a phone so that he could go watch something on his own, when I relized that it was 2:30AM. This is not out of the ordinary for him to have a few days that he is ready to go. We have learned that this is part of his ADHD and his mind is just running and ready to go. Fighting it only makes for starting off what could have been a good day on a bad note. I let him go downstairs and he stayed quiet for the most part and let everyone sleep. When I came down just before 6 he greeted me with cheer, let me have my coffee and we proceeded to have some special time. We build with magnet tiles, legos, played a game, and even went outside to continue carving our path through the woods. I cherish our special time together in happiness and am glad that we are learning to work with his disorder and have more good days like this.</p>

<h4 id="peace">Peace</h4>
<p>Today I am strugging to come up with a new topic for my gratitude journal. I feel like I have written about many of the things I am grateful for recently. As I am sitting here with a nice display of color and listening to the frogs, from our kids's lighted sound machine of course. I realize that I am just enjoying this moment of peace. It is nice to not have to worry about anything for a few minutes and just let the words flow. I think this is why I enjoy doing this gratitude journal, becuase I feel a nice sense of peace after completeing it for the day. Sometimes the days are crazy, sometimes they are normal, sometimes they are quiet each day is new and none like the other. But whatever the day brings most of them have included this 5 minutes of peace for the last 35 days. Thank you Rhiannon for pushing me to start this journal.</p>

<p>Today I am grateful that I am able to communicate with my beautiful wife Rhiannon. I am so glad that we are able to help each other out on our worst days, and keep going even after our bad moments. We are able to grow and build off of each other. I am grateful that we have an open and honest relationship that we are able to talk about anything. We have had a rough month, and will continue to have a rough patch until after Feb. 20. Its to be expected that we have these patches with her illness. I am really grateful that we are able to get through them together, so that we can enjoy the good days. Good days are coming, lets make the best out of the rough ones together.</p>

<h4 id="safety">Safety</h4>
<p>Today started out like most days, morning routine, kids in the car and headed to preschool. Since Rhiannon got the January mug at Starbucks we have been stopping there for the morning coffee on the way to preschool. As we were leaving a police car came roaring from the parking lot lights on right behind us. There was an accident at the intersection right in front of Starbucks. Passing by the accident it clearly looked like one car took more damage than the other, and that it was from being hit by another car and pushed into a pole at a high speed. My heart goes out to them! It made me really grateful that we have not been in any accidents, especially because we typically drive down a very crazy road in the mornings. It is not uncommon to come accross accidents along the way.</p>

<p>This weekend was an abnormally warm January weekend, which meant that we were able to ge the kids out and moving more than normal. On Saturday we started to build Wyatt Walkers Walking path through the thick brush. Both kids were really into it and were guiding me through the thick brush letting me know where the path should turn next. Wyatt kept very busy with his tree pruners trimming the leftover branches.</p>
<p>On Sunday the kids and I went out to the skate park while mommy had a lunch date with a friend. Ayla enjoyed throwing a small frisbee off of the top of the pyramid while Wyatt rode his scooter and daddy's skateboard around the park.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need a bit of help and it is hard to pick yourself up. This morning was one of those days. I just felt overwhelmed and like there was no stopping it. Rhiannon gave me a call and after talking through some things I felt a huge weight lifted. I wouldn't say that I was healed, but I would say I was on a good trajectory. It's really hard to battle things as a family. We are all in it together and that picking each other up will help everyone.</p>

<p>Last night was a night that I had to run back into work late at night to run some analysis. I was able to get in and get it done fairly quickly, and it felt really good to have it done and not have to worry about it in the last hour before the presentation. I also stuck to my No More Death by powerpoint rule, and did not include an eye chart in the slides. This was something that I always said I would change when I took over the role, but never did. Now that I have vowed to never again break the principles of Death by PowerPoint I had to change.</p>
<p>Secondly my wife is a rockstar. She was up with our crazy son most of the night, as he was really struggling to sleep. He was just up and ready to go really early in the morning. I am grateful that I was able to get somme sleep, and really hope that she is able to get some rest while the house is quiet today.</p>

<p>I am not sure that time heals all wounds, but some wounds just take time. Yesterday during therapy Rhiannon finally had a chance to talk about some very tough topics. It was very tough to talk about at the time, and I did have a bit of a rough afternoon following the appointment. I am not sure why, but I just needed some space and time. Today I feel quite a bit better and am ready to start my day on a good note! I am not sure how long it will take for these wounds to heal but time will help.</p>
<p>I am very grateful that Rhiannon was able to give me some space and time yesterday after our appointment. I know that it is very difficult for her to see me down. I am also very grateful that she setup therapy for us and has given us this outlet to discuss topics like this. I am grateful that we were able to bring it up and talk about it with a neutral party.</p>

<p><a href="www.cuttinscrap.com">CuttinScrap.com</a> was released last night!!! I am very excited with how it is turning out. I am even more excited to see Rhiannon start using it and getting some more content built up. This is the by far the biggest front end project that I have ever done. I think most of all I really like seeing how much Rhiannon likes site. She seems blown away and has commented that she did not think that it would turn out anywhere close to this good. She would have been proud to own it either way just knowing that I built it for her. Seeing her face light up during each preview that we did really kept me going to finish.</p>

<p>On Thursday I got the call that Rhiannon had passes out during physical therapy. I went right to her therapy office to find her rehydrating in a chair. She seemed ok and that this would pass and be ok. When trying to get up again she passed out. Three days later we are back home from the hospital and she is still passing out. All we know is that she has cancer and she is struggling to keep her blood pressure up while standing. I am very grateful that we have the friends we have to take care of everything at home for us. Most of all I am grateful that we are able to keep it calm and collected. Too many folks get very worked up through these events and it is not productive. Our job is to remain calm, stay focused on the things that we are able to do that help her, and let the doctors do their job. We have enough doctors involved that if there was something to find, it would have been found. I really hope that we can get her back on her feet where she is not passing out everytime that she stands up. But for now, I am keeping my calm, staying positive, spending time with the kids, and doing the tasks that help us function through the day.</p>

<p>I am so grateful that I have Rhiannon in my life. Last night we were able to go out of our way to help a family member in need. I am so proud that she is able to stand up for what is right and help someone who really needs it. This family member was in a really dark place and Rhiannon was able to spot that and stand up to help her. This person really just needed someone there for her, to give her a hug, and not feel alone. I am so proud of Rhiannon for being able to hold this persons hand, and walk her to a better place in life.</p>
<p>I think there is a real sense of maturity that comes with being there yourslef and climbing out of that hole and realizing how much better life is on the other side if you can just put your head down, make some hard decisions and consiously control your life and direct it to where you want it to be.</p>

Its exciting that there is so much low hanging fruit to be had. In my previous role as an engineer I was in a very established role. While this role was great, I really enjoyed it, and had no intentions of moving until this oppotunity landed in my lap. I felt like being in such an establishd role the job was to follow the processes that had been previously set up. Now being in a much less established role there is a lot more room for creativity. I like getting to work and really being excited to get to work creating things that add value to the organization.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need some time to be a kid. Today was that day... it was a snow day. During which the kids were very generous at letting me work, but we were also able to have some quality moments. First of which happened at lunch. Wyatt decided that we were having pancakes, and the kids would help make them. I was really impressed at their cooperation. They did really well at taking turns putting ingredients into the batter, and stirring.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The second bit of kid time came late in the afternoon after the kids had a nap. We went outside to go sledding. They were both a bit crabby to get clothes on, but cheered up once we got outside. We all had a blast, Even Ayla who has had a terrible fear of the snow this year. She just stood in it for the longest time before warming up to it. Eventually she braved up enough, aka was forced on to the sled with daddy. She loved it! She was absolutely smiling ear to ear when we hit the bottom. From there on the kids took turns riding down with daddy for the next 2 hrs!</p>

<p>There is something special about having pure uninterrupted adult time with your spouse. Last night I went out with Rhiannon and we had an absolute blast. We went to the brand new brewery in town &quot;Industry Brewing Company&quot;. It was absolutely amazing. The food was good, but the beer was completely flawless. There is just something beautiful about something that is so flawless. Each style I had was brewed to a T. My favorite of course was the &quot;Industry Standard&quot;, a super hoppy pale ale.</p>
<p>Next we were off to the local big box quilting store to get some supplies for Rhiannon's next project on Cuttin Scrap. It was fun, we looked at a bunch of different stuff. And she was able to talk shop.</p>
<p>After that we were off to see the latest Pitch perfect movie. before we were able to do that I required coffee to stay up through the whole thing. So we went downtown to check out Zion coffee roasters for the first time. It was a beautiful shop that reminded me of Horizon Line Coffee in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. We finished the night off in the movies and headed home.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to be able to spend such quality time with my best friend. We have great friends that are able to watch the crazy kids. We are able to afford a simple night out. Lastly Rhiannon and I are getting closer than we ever have before.</p>

<p>Recently the kids have really been into singing in the car with Daddy on the way to and from Preshool. It is so fun, because we are all belting it out so loud, and each take over for our special parts. It's interesting how Ayla has grown into liking it. For the longest time I thought that she did not like Wyatt and I being so loud, but she never complained about it. Then over the past week I noticed during some parts of the songs she is the <strong>LOUDEST</strong> one in the car. After each song the kids both ask, &quot;Did I sing the whole song?&quot;, and I try to get super into it and have a very motivational Radio DJ style of voice encouraging them to continue and tell them how well they did.</p>

The only difference last night was that it was not the wee hours of the day, it was <strong>11:30 PM</strong>. He was wired and ready to go as if he slept the whole night through. I am very grateful that I was able to tag team the situation with Rhiannon, as he did not go back to sleep. We were both able to get some rest through the night. It may not have been the best, but we were able to make the best out of a tough situation. In the Morning we had to take the van into the repair shop, and on the way home we were able to discuss some solutions to the problem when it happens in the future. Rhiannon was able to get the ball rolling with the pediatrician to see their recommendations. Man I love her, long before I would have even thought to go that route she had already sent the message out.</p>

<p>Tonight was the last night of the big holiday vacation and I finally got that special moment with every single family member over break. It was Ayla's turn tonight. We had our break when Wyatt wanted mommy to play MineCraft with him and did not want daddy to play. Ayla's hair looked like a bird was trying to built its nest in it. We made our way upstairs with a spray bottle, comb, brush and a whole lot of excitement. We filled the spray bottle with water, and I let Ayla start going to town spraying everything in sight. Although it was explicitly stated that it would not be used for its intended purpose, detangling hair. Thats ok though as I was able to get some moisture in with my hands. I continued to do my first french braid on her. The first attempt was a fail as Ayla was moving too much and I lost it. The second attemt was a success. After this Ayla proceeded to water, brush, wipe, and comb daddy's har over the next hour!</p>
<p>I ran out of time, but I will still mention that she painted her first set of toes.</p>

Sometimes we struggle with Wyatt's energy in a house with lots of breakable items, but he did great yesterday. When we got home Wyatt just finished up with a good two hour nap and was wired... at 11:00 PM. He was hungry, as he was too excited to play while at grandmas house and did not eat much. I sat up with him, we shared a peanut butter sandwich and got out a new pack of trolls characters and worked on finding all of their names.</p>

Today we had a few minutes to play before supper time, and we decided to go down to the basement to play some imagination action adventure game. The kids are really into minecraft at the moment so its always very centered around minecraft. Tonight there was an extra special moment where Wyatt on his own gave Ayla his brand new nerf gun to play with. At this point he has not alowed her to play with it because it was a new Christmas toy. She was extatic, and we all enjoyed running from her as she shot towards us. I thought it was extra special because we were all having fun and no one was arguing about who got the new toy. I am so proud of Wyatt, because he is really growing up and growing out of the not sharing phase. I have really seen him open up to share an play with Ayla in new ways lately. It really makes you feel like a good parent when you can watch them grow up like this.</p>

<p>I am glad everyone was able to enjoy the food. Both events were very accomodating to our family allergies. The first event was a potato bar where everything was kept separate and you could personalize your dish. The kids really just wanted to snack all day. At the second event they went out of their way to find dairy free butter to cook wtih. There were only one or two items that had dairy in them. It feels good to be supported by your family.</p>

<h4 id="strength">Strength</h4>
<p>I have been getting back on my feet after a long turn of a low mindset. My wife has been my main inspiration through this process. She is working very hard herself to be a more positive person, and has been for several months. She has been my inspiration. I have started this journal, drinking keytones, tracking goals, keeping up with email, trello, using pomodoro, and started working out. All of these steps are giving me strength to keep a positive attitude through a very rough time in our life. I am very happy with the improvements that I have made over the last 8 days, and glad that these changes are giving me the strength to keep a positive attitude through the day.</p>

<p>After working out for the first time in a long time I feel great this morning. My body feels stronger, I have more energy, and I feel that I can hold my positive attitude through more events in the day. I am grateful that I was able to get this system in place, and I am ready to continue executing through 2018.</p>

<h4 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h4>
<p>I am grateful for the accommodations that have been made for our family medical situation. I enjoy being able to support everyone in their appointments, and making sure that everyone is able to get where they need to be every day. Without these kind of accommodations it would be impossible to keep everyone healthy. Some career paths would not have allowed this as working in person at a specified time is crutial.</p>

<p>My job allows me to work almost any hour that I can. There are meetings and events that I need to be in person for, but those are only a small portion of the work. The one thing that I have struggled with since our move is being productive at home. The new house is a completely different environment than I am used to. There are lots of distractions and <strong>SLOW</strong> internet. The internet speed is so slow that I tend to get distracted and do other things when something that is usually executed within a few ms takes 30s or more. I know it sounds rediculous but when every step takes this much extra time it gets very distracting. It is something that I just need to learn to work with, and keep a project ready to work with little to no internet at all times.</p>

<h4 id="restart">Restart</h4>
<p>Restarting each day is important for a very healthy attitude. Having a son with ADHD there are times where we need to restart each hour on a new foot. His mind runs at such a faster pace than everyone else's that is can be hard to keep up with him. Sometimes we have meltdowns. It is very important to be able to coach him through it, present him with a resolution, and walk away. It is very hard as an adult to quickly bring down your emotions form a very high stress situation, but it is important for him to avoid going right back into another meltdown. Our family is very good at restarting each day on a new foot and not holding grudges against each other. This keeps us very strong through such hard times.</p>

<h4 id="family">Family</h4>
<p>Having a close family is one of the most important things in life. They keep us grounded. They are able to tell us things that no one else can. We are able to share our whole lives with out family. Having a supportive family is very important, because without their support things get awkward. I am glad to live in a family where we can talk about anything, and support each other through almost anything as well, though we aren't afraid to point out each others dumb ideas if something really seems off. There is also the physical part of family. We are able to share some of the workloads. Today we had some extra family in the house and it was nice to have a few minutes here and there that I could get away and know that someone would take care of the kids if they needed something.</p>

<h4 id="sleep">Sleep</h4>
<p>It does not get enough recognition, some good quality rest is very benefitial to start off a good day. Yesterday I was dragging.. hard. Wyatt was up at 2 A.M. and I was the one to be up with him... for awhile. Today, he was up early again, but let me sleep, then proceeded to take a morning nap. This combined with an early rest time started my day off on a good note. I was able to wake up when ready, and start my day at my own pace. I was able to get coffee and breakfast before being asked to do much.</p>

<h4 id="coffee">coffee</h4>
I enjoy starting my day off with a nice cup of coffee. Today, I had a nice fresh thirty-thirty guatememala. I am very grateful that we are able to afford nice coffee, it really energizes me compared to the really dark mass produced coffee that is typically found everywhere.

<h4 id="community">Community</h4>
<p>I know that I am not the most social person that is ready to talk to everyone in the room about anything. I am still grateful for the communities that I am a part of. Without our group of friends we would not be able to make it through all of the medical issues that we have had throughout the past few years. Rhiannon and I are currently making great strides in our marriage and fincance thanks to the great help from Scott and Ali. Without Rhiannon's medical community she would not be here today. From getting her diagnosis to executing their plans every step along the way has given her more years on her life. Those years will be happily spent with the kids and I.</p>

<h4 id="persistence">Persistence</h4>
<p>Persistence is one of the great talents of my wife. Today I am grateful for her persistence because she has the medicine that she needs for her MRI today. Yesterday there was a struggle to get the doctors to get her prescription submitted to the pharmacy, and after calling many times she got it done within the last hour of the pharmacies operating hours. Seriously who can get a prescription filled after 7:00PM! I am just glad that she is able to have the medicine that she needs today. It will make the procedure much easier.</p>

Seriously though without her persistence she would not even be here today. Her persistence to get an accurate diagnosis was what kept her alive on more than one occasion. There is something to be said for trusting your gut and standing behind what you believe in.

<p>Thank You for getting up with me this morning. I really appreciate all of the extra help. It means a lot to have my life partner there with me in the morning helping with the kids.</p>
<h4 id="thank-you">Thank You</h4>
<p>Those two words are very powerful. This morning when I was helping Rhiannon cut her hair she looked at me and told me thank you very sincerely. It cut really deep inside, and made me feel really good. I dont think I expressed my gratitude for it very well as I had not yet had my coffee, and my response time was a bit lacking. This is something that I would like to work on with my kids. We really focus on our please's but, sometimes Thank Yous are forgotten, and we are just happy that they are happy.</p>

<h4 id="time-off">Time Off</h4>
<p>I am currently in the middle of a week long holiday break. Its nice to take some time off from the everyday hustle to refresh the brain and focus on some other things. We are able to do quite a bit of traveling and see family that we do not get to see very often. I am able to spend more time with my wife and the kids. I have also started making a website for my wife. Its probably something that I would not otherwise have time to dig deeply into and make nearly the same progress as quickly.</p>
<p>The time in the car can be a nice time to connect. We have taken quite a bit of time to plan out Rhiannon's new adventure, CuttinScrap. It is a YouTube channel that will serve as her creative outlet, combining her love of speech and Drama with Crafting. I am really excited to see her find her voice and get into a rhythm with the channel. She is really excited as well. We have been doing a lot of planning and behind the scenes work and anxiously awaiting time to make episode 0.</p>
