<div class="card"><h2>Rhiannon</h2><p>is a strong willed super mom.  She is the organization fanatic of the bunch.  She keeps us running on time, and everything in order.  In November of 2016 she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer.  It is something that is not treatable, and we are learning to live with.  She has been inspired to go back to school as a doctor when she is able to get back on her feet again.  I cannot wait to begin that chapter of life with her, because it is something she is so passionate about.  If you want to help us on her journey you can support her <span class="pink"><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/Aylasmedicalfund">gofundme</a></span>.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>Wyatt</h2><p>is the most energetic boy one can imagine.  He definitely keeps us on out toes.  His imagination is always running wild.  Minecraft is by far his biggest passion in life at the moment.  It is something that allows him to have a creative outlet that has enough action to fill his desire. As you watch him play, you can see that the game has become an extension of himself.  He is able to run through the world with such ease.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>Ayla</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmodtempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
